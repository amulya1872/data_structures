'''There are N ticket sellers each of whom has a certain amount of tickets. The price of a ticket is the number of tickets remaining with the ticket seller. They can sell a total of K tickets. Find the maximum amount they can earn by selling K tickets.

Input:
The first line of the input consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the test case consists of two lines. First line of each test case consists of two integers N and K. The next line contains space separated N integers A[0], A[1], …, A[N-1] where A[i] denotes the number of ticket with ith ticket seller.

Output:
For each test case, print in a new line, the maximum amount they can earn by selling K tickets. Print your answer modulo 109 + 7​

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai, K <= 106

Example:
Input:
2
5 3
4 3 6 2 4
6 2
5 3 5 2 4 4
Output:
15
10

Explanation:
Assume 0-based indexing
Testcase 1:
Firstly, 2nd ticket seller can sell his one ticket at price = 6.
 Then, he will have 5 tickets with price = 5.
He can again sell one ticket with price = 5.
 Now, he will have 4 tickets with price = 4. 
At last, any of the 0th, 2nd or 4th ticket seller can sell one ticket as all of them are priced at 4.
 Hence, the total amount after selling 3 tickets = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

Testcase 2:
Firstly, 0th or 2nd ticket seller can sell his one ticket at price = 5.
 Let us assume that 2nd ticket seller sells his ticket. Now, he would be left with 4 tickets each with price = 4.
 Now, 0th ticket seller will sell his one ticket at price = 5 and now he will have 4 tickets each with price = 4. 
Hence, the total amount after selling 2 tickets = 5 + 5 = 10.'''
