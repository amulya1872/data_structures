'''Find the maximum amount that can be collected by selling movie tickets
Given an integer N and an array seats[] where N is the number of people standing
 in a line to buy a movie ticket and seat[i] is the number of empty seats in the
 ith row of the movie theater. The task is to find the maximum amount a theater owner
 can make by selling movie tickets to N people. Price of a ticket is equal to the maximum number of empty seats among all the rows.

Example:

Input: seats[] = {1, 2, 4}, N = 3
Output: 9

PERSON	EMPTY SEATS	TICKET COST
1	1 2 4	           4
2	1 2 3	           3
3	1 2 2	           2
4 + 3 + 2 = 9

Input: seats[] = {2, 3, 5, 3}, N = 4
Output: 15'''
