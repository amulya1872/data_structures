'''Next Greater Element
Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.

Examples:

For any array, rightmost element always has next greater element as -1.
For an array which is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have next greater element as -1.
For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25}, the next greater elements for each element are as follows.
Element       NGE
   4      -->   5
   5      -->   25
   2      -->   25
   25     -->   -1   '''
